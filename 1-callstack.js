/*

Basically this will tell you how javascript works?

Javascript is single threaded programming language. that means it can execute code line by line.

whenever js program start to execute it creates global execution context in that every line of code will execute.

So javasctipt first scans through your prgram and gave memory to all your variables, functions, arrow functions.

variables and arrow functions have undefined value and for functions it stores whole functions.

then value will be assign at the execution time.

function it self have its own execution context.
